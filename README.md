# CMPS-3240-Cache-Blocking
Implement cache blocking with DAXPY

# Prerequisites

1. Read the 'Software Optimization via Blocking' subsection in Chapter 5.4 of the textbook

## Requirements

* The lab is intended to be run on a POSIX (Linux or MAC) operating system. *But, the lab can be made to run on a Windows machine with the modifications we discussed before, such as changing the header file, using `load` instead of `loadu` etc. The textbook's code snippets are what you need in this scenario.*
* This repository:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/DrAlbertCruz/CMPS-3240-Cache-Blocking.git
```
and make the files using:
```shell
$ make all
```
